## The perfect travel app

Framey is a travel app that let's you pick the best places to take photos in new
destinations and also recommends cool new destinations to travel to.

I worked on Framey as contractor with the company, focusing on developing the
mobile application, the backend server, database and the dashboard to administer
the content that the users will see. The travel destinations and attractions are
all managed from the admin dashboard and they can adapt based on user feedback.
